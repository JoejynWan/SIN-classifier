The outputs of SIN-classifier will be saved in this folder. Specify the name of the output folder using `OUTPUT_DIR` in config.py. 

Some things to note: 
1) The output folder will be generated automatically if there is none. 
2) If there are files in the output folder, the script will give a warning if these files should be replaced. If its okay for these files to be replaced, input `Y` into the command prompt when this warning pops up.
